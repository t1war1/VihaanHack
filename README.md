Fighting Disabilities
# Idea
‘BeMySight’ is an assistive app for the blind people. It will support blind people with everyday tasks. The person just has to click a picture of the object and record an audio message regarding the query and it will be uploaded to the server. From the server, it will be passed to active clients in the network. Clients are the people who want to help the disabled for the social cause. 
Then the client gives a response about the object which is delivered to the disabled in the form of an audio message. 
# Identification tools and implementations 

1.    One-tab camera and audio click 
2.    Socket.io to broadcast the image and audio to active clients.
3.    Express.js for creating servers.
4.    Node.js for the backend.
